project web page; upload files to ftp site
svn mailing list does not work (opened support ticket #101312 on 3/26)
strip out XMLSpy line in svn config
add enchanted side to tiles
multi-realm support in xml files (setup, scenario, game files)
GUI:

cities3d has been inactive for ~3 months now

(a 'PBEM player' game tracks an exiting PBEM game from a player's
perspective, not DM; a DM would probably just use the 'single-player' game
option)
