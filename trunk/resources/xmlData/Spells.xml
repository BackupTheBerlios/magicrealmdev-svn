    <Source>MR</Source>
    <Description>This spell can be cast only if the optional weather rules are being used. The target is the face-down number chit that will define next week's weather. When the spell goes into effect the spellcaster can either look at this chit secretly or, without looking at it, insist that a new chit be picked using the normal method. If a new chit is picked, he does not look at it. &lt;i&gt;Comment:&lt;/i&gt; A character usually must cast this spell several times to get the weather he wants. He must cast it once to look at the chit, a second time to change it, a third to look at the new chit, and so on.</Description>

    <Description>This &lt;i&gt;Permanent&lt;/i&gt; spell has already been cast on the FLYING CARPET card. When the spell is energized, the card can be used as a FLY chit with Medium strength and a time number of 2. The owner of the card can play it once per round of combat, using it repeatedly (the spell does not expire after one use). The card's owner can use it to fly during his turn. See rule 47. This spell cannot be broken - when spellbreaking spells are used against it, the spell just becomes inert. It can be re-energized immediately, as soon as it is supplied with &lt;i&gt;PURPLE&lt;/i&gt; magic.</Description>
