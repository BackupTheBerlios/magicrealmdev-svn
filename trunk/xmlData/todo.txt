		[selector] specifies a restricted XPath ([bib-xpath]) expression relative to instances of the element being declared. This must identify a node set of subordinate elements (i.e. contained within the declared element) to which the constraint applies.

[fields] specifies XPath expressions relative to each element selected by a [selector]. This must identify a single node (element or attribute) whose content or value, which must be of a simple type, is used in the constraint. It is possible to specify an ordered list of [fields]s, to cater to multi-field keys, keyrefs, and uniqueness constraints.

In order to reduce the burden on implementers, in particular implementers of streaming processors, only restricted subsets of XPath expressions are allowed in [selector] and [fields]. The details are given in [Constraints on Identity-constraint Definition Schema Components].


  make the list of natives a substitution group??

  sub group? -> chit type
  
  Fight, Move, Spell
    Berzerk  Duck      


  move to xml files:

CharacterSpecialAdvantageType
  include description + effect
  eg: 
    Phase / Bonus / Move + 1
    Phase / Unavailable / Sunlight (Cave, Dwarf)
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
<!-- todo: id must be unique per character
is this id useful? can just refer to a character's chit by character name and number (1-12);
there's probably an xpath expression to take the i'th child element
